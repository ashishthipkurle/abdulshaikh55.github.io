A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes (also called points or vertices) and edges (also called lines or arcs) with a tree-like structure. A tree can either be an empty tree, or a node with a list of successor trees. 

Nodes are usually labelled with a data item. It is called *value*.

The node at the top of the tree is called as the *root node*. The root node is at the top because, a tree is always shaped like a, well, tree, and the nodes connected to the root are called children of the root.
