# Linked list

A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a collection of 'nodes' together via links i.e. pointers. A node consists of data value and a pointer to the address of the next node within the linked list. Nodes are not stored at contiguous locations, rather they are linked using pointers to different memory locations.

A linked list starts with a head node which points to the starting node of the linked list. Every node consists of data which holds the value associated with the node and a pointer which holds the memory address of the next node in linked list.

The last node is called the tail node in the list which points to null indicating the end of the list.

## Types of linked list

1. Singly linked list
2. Doubly linked list
3. Circular linked list
