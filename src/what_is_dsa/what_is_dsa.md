# What is Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms are closely connected, like space and time. A data structure is like space where many things exist and can move freely. This space has planets, stars, galaxies, and more. Some things move in a predictable way, while others don't. 
But without time, these things don't matter. Nothing happens, and nothing changes.

It's the same with data structures and algorithms. Without algorithms, data is useless, and without data structures, algorithms can't work.
We use algorithms to create, access, update, and delete data structures.

In short, data structures and algorithms are like two sides of the same coin. One can't exist without the other.

The ability to write an efficient algorithm depends on the organization of data in an appropriate manner. This means algorithms can only be as good as the data structure they are designed for. In this book, we will learn how to design and implement data structures and algorithms.
