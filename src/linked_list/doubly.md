# Doubly linked list

A node in doubly linked list consists of three parts; one part is data, other two parts are previous pointer and next pointer. The previous pointer holds the address of the previous node in linked list, the data part holds the actual data, and the next part holds the address of the next node in the linked list

As we have the address of the next as well as the previous node we can traverse in both directions in the linked list.
